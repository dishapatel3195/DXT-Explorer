# DTX Explorer

You need to have Python 3 and install some required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You also need to have Darshan Utils installed (`darshan-dxt-parser`) and available in your path.

Once you have the dependencies installed, you can run:

```bash
python3 explore.py DARSHAN_FILE_COLLECTED_WITH_DXT_ENABLE.darshan
```

It will generate a `explore.html` file with an interactive plot that you can open in any browser to explore.
